This incredible library enables you to manipulate two very important objects in the Python language \u2014 the 1 dimensional <code>Series</code> and the two dimensional <code>DataFrame</code>. These objects are part of a lot of data pipelines and mastering them is crucial to start your Pytyon career.</p> <p>Dataframes are widely used throughout data science and analytics, as they enable the creation of multidimensional and multi-type objects. The goal of this post is to provide a very complete guide on how to use some famous <code>pandas</code> functions and how to work with the most important features of the library. Hopefully, after reading this guide, you will be ready to work with the most important <code>pandas</code> eatures. It may also be very common that you are migrating from a SQL background, so I\u2019ll try to leave a comparison with SQL code throughout some instructions in the post, so that it is easier to compare the instructions between the two frameworks. But, keep in mind that knowing SQL is definitely not a requirement to learn <code>pandas</code> !</p>"},{"location":"A%20collective%20list%20of%20free%20APIs/","title":"A collective list of free APIs","text":"<p>[[ReadItLater]] [[Article]]</p>"},{"location":"A%20collective%20list%20of%20free%20APIs/#github-public-apispublic-apis-a-collective-list-of-free-apis","title":"GitHub - public-apis/public-apis: A collective list of free APIs","text":""},{"location":"A%20collective%20list%20of%20free%20APIs/#try-public-apis-for-free","title":"Try Public APIs for free","text":"<p>The Public APIs repository is manually curated by community members like you and folks working at APILayer.

A particularly interesting self-organizing data structure is the splay tree, which uses rotations to move any accessed key to the root.\" - Skiena</p> </li> <li> <p>Of these, I chose to implement a splay tree. From what I've read, you won't implement a balanced search tree in your interview. But I wanted exposure to coding one up and let's face it, splay trees are the bee's knees. I did read a lot of red-black tree code</p> <ul> <li>Splay tree: insert, search, delete functions If you end up implementing a red/black tree try just these:</li> <li>Search and insertion functions, skipping delete<ul> <li>I want to learn more about B-Tree since it's used so widely with very large data sets</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Self-balancing binary search tree</p> </li> <li> <p>AVL trees</p> <ul> <li>In practice: From what I can tell, these aren't used much in practice, but I could see where they would be: The AVL tree is another structure supporting O(log n) search, insertion, and removal. It is more rigidly balanced than red\u2013black trees, leading to slower insertion and removal but faster retrieval. This makes it attractive for data structures that may be built once and loaded without reconstruction, such as language dictionaries (or program dictionaries, such as the opcodes of an assembler or interpreter)</li> <li>MIT AVL Trees / AVL Sort (video)</li> <li>AVL Trees (video)</li> <li>AVL Tree Implementation (video)</li> <li>Split And Merge</li> <li> <p>[Review] AVL Trees (playlist) in 19 minutes (video)</p> <ul> <li>Splay trees</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>In practice: Splay trees are typically used in the implementation of caches, memory allocators, routers, garbage collectors, data compression, ropes (replacement of string used for long text strings), in Windows NT (in the virtual memory, networking and file system code) etc</p> </li> <li>CS 61B: Splay Trees (video)</li> <li> <p>MIT Lecture: Splay Trees:</p> <ul> <li>Gets very mathy, but watch the last 10 minutes for sure.</li> <li>Video</li> <li>Red/black trees</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>These are a translation of a 2-3 tree (see below).</p> </li> <li>In practice: Red\u2013black trees offer worst-case guarantees for insertion time, deletion time, and search time. Not only does this make them valuable in time-sensitive applications such as real-time applications, but it makes them valuable building blocks in other data structures that provide worst-case guarantees; for example, many data structures used in computational geometry can be based on red-black trees, and the Completely Fair Scheduler used in current Linux kernels uses red\u2013black trees. In version 8 of Java, the Collection HashMap has been modified such that instead of using a LinkedList to store identical elements with poor hashcodes, a Red-Black tree is used</li> <li>Aduni - Algorithms - Lecture 4 (link jumps to the starting point) (video)</li> <li>Aduni - Algorithms - Lecture 5 (video)</li> <li>Red-Black Tree</li> <li>An Introduction To Binary Search And Red Black Tree</li> <li> <p>[Review] Red-Black Trees (playlist) in 30 minutes (video)</p> <ul> <li>2-3 search trees</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>In practice: 2-3 trees have faster inserts at the expense of slower searches (since height is more compared to AVL trees).</p> </li> <li>You would use 2-3 trees very rarely because its implementation involves different types of nodes. Instead, people use Red-Black trees.</li> <li>23-Tree Intuition and Definition (video)</li> <li>Binary View of 23-Tree</li> <li> <p>2-3 Trees (student recitation) (video)</p> <ul> <li>2-3-4 Trees (aka 2-4 trees)</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>In practice: For every 2-4 trees, there are corresponding red\u2013black trees with data elements in the same order. The insertion and deletion operations on 2-4 trees are also equivalent to color-flipping and rotations in red\u2013black trees. This makes 2-4 trees an important tool for understanding the logic behind red-black trees, and this is why many introductory algorithm texts introduce 2-4 trees just before red\u2013black trees, even though 2-4 trees are not often used in practice.</p> </li> <li>CS 61B Lecture 26: Balanced Search Trees (video)</li> <li>Bottom Up 234-Trees (video)</li> <li> <p>Top Down 234-Trees (video)</p> <ul> <li>N-ary (K-ary, M-ary) trees</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>note: the N or K is the branching factor (max branches)</p> </li> <li>binary trees are a 2-ary tree, with branching factor = 2</li> <li>2-3 trees are 3-ary</li> <li> <p>K-Ary Tree</p> <ul> <li>B-Trees</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Fun fact: it's a mystery, but the B could stand for Boeing, Balanced, or Bayer (co-inventor).</p> </li> <li>In Practice: B-trees are widely used in databases. Most modern filesystems use B-trees (or Variants). In addition to its use in databases, the B-tree is also used in filesystems to allow quick random access to an arbitrary block in a particular file.

Each of these certifications involves building 5 required web app projects, along with hundreds of optional coding challenges to help you prepare for those projects. We estimate that each certification will take a beginner programmer around 300 hours to earn.</p> <p>Each of these 50 projects in the freeCodeCamp.org curriculum has its own agile user stories and automated tests. These help you build up your project incrementally and ensure you've fulfilled all the user stories before you submit it.</p> <p>You can pull in these test suites through freeCodeCamp's CDN. This means you can build these projects on websites like CodePen and Replit - or even on your local computer's development environment.</p> <p>Once you've earned a certification, you will always have it. You will always be able to link to it from your LinkedIn or resume. And when your prospective employers or freelance clients click that link, they'll see a verified certification specific to you.</p> <p>The one exception to this is if we discover violations of our Academic Honesty Policy. When we catch people unambiguously plagiarizing (submitting other people's code or projects as their own without citation), we do what all rigorous institutions of learning should do - we revoke their certifications and ban those people.</p> <p>Here are our twelve core certifications:</p>"},{"location":"FreeCodeCamp/#1-responsive-web-design-certification","title":"1.
