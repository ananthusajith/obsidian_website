When you start to work with Python in the context of Data Analysis, Engineering or Science, `pandas`is (likely) one of the first libraries that you will have to learn about. This incredible library enables you to manipulate two very important objects in the Python language — the 1 dimensional `Series` and the two dimensional `DataFrame`. These objects are part of a lot of data pipelines and mastering them is crucial to start your Pytyon career.

Dataframes are widely used throughout data science and analytics, as they enable the creation of multidimensional and multi-type objects. The goal of this post is to provide a very complete guide on how to use some famous `pandas` functions and how to work with the most important features of the library. Hopefully, after reading this guide, you will be ready to work with the most important `pandas` eatures. It may also be very common that you are migrating from a SQL background, so I’ll try to leave a comparison with SQL code throughout some instructions in the post, so that it is easier to compare the instructions between the two frameworks. But, keep in mind that knowing SQL is definitely not a requirement to learn `pandas` !
