There is a rule in negotiations: The party who reveals the number 1st will most likely get the worst deal. It may happen they have a budget bigger than the amount that you asked for. So tell then it is negotiable.  
Tell them you are just starting the process and are not sure what to expect most will say industry standard is 30%, you reply them to keep it as negotiable.  

One can easily get 50%+ with basic negotiations. Seen a few with even 150% hike.

Your new offer is 5/15 ~= 33% that's the least that you should accept only if they say they cannot go beyond this and that too should be used to negotiate for other offers.

Don't change if you don't get 50%+.

Also the hiring market is down, and would take 6 more months to show positivity.  
I would suggest you to keep upskilling and interviewing and be prepared in 2024 when the demand is higher you will get a much better offer.
