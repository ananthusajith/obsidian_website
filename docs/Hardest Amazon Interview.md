title: "Rotting Oranges - LeetCode"
description: "Can you solve this real interview question? Rotting Oranges - You are given an m x n grid where each cell can have one of three values: * 0 representing an empty cell, * 1 representing a fresh orange, or * 2 representing a rotten orange.Every minute, any fresh orange that is 4-directionally adjacent to a rotten orange becomes rotten.Return the minimum number of minutes that must elapse until no cell has a fresh orange. If this is impossible, return -1. Example 1:[https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/02/16/oranges.png]Input: grid = [[2,1,1],[1,1,0],[0,1,1]]Output: 4Example 2:Input: grid = [[2,1,1],[0,1,1],[1,0,1]]Output: -1Explanation: The orange in the bottom left corner (row 2, column 0) is never rotten, because rotting only happens 4-directionally.Example 3:Input: grid = [[0,2]]Output: 0Explanation: Since there are already no fresh oranges at minute 0, the answer is just 0. Constraints: * m == grid.length * n == grid[i].length * 1 <= m, n <= 10 * grid[i][j] is 0, 1, or 2."

title: "Word Ladder - LeetCode"
description: "Can you solve this real interview question? Word Ladder - A transformation sequence from word beginWord to word endWord using a dictionary wordList is a sequence of words beginWord -> s1 -> s2 -> ... -> sk such that: * Every adjacent pair of words differs by a single letter. * Every si for 1 <= i <= k is in wordList. Note that beginWord does not need to be in wordList. * sk == endWordGiven two words, beginWord and endWord, and a dictionary wordList, return the number of words in the shortest transformation sequence from beginWord to endWord, or 0 if no such sequence exists. Example 1:Input: beginWord = \"hit\", endWord = \"cog\", wordList = [\"hot\",\"dot\",\"dog\",\"lot\",\"log\",\"cog\"]Output: 5Explanation: One shortest transformation sequence is \"hit\" -> \"hot\" -> \"dot\" -> \"dog\" -> cog\", which is 5 words long.Example 2:Input: beginWord = \"hit\", endWord = \"cog\", wordList = [\"hot\",\"dot\",\"dog\",\"lot\",\"log\"]Output: 0Explanation: The endWord \"cog\" is not in wordList, therefore there is no valid transformation sequence. Constraints: * 1 <= beginWord.length <= 10 * endWord.length == beginWord.length * 1 <= wordList.length <= 5000 * wordList[i].length == beginWord.length * beginWord, endWord, and wordList[i] consist of lowercase English letters. * beginWord != endWord * All the words in wordList are unique."

title: "House Robber - LeetCode"
description: "Can you solve this real interview question? House Robber - You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, the only constraint stopping you from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security systems connected and it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night.Given an integer array nums representing the amount of money of each house, return the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police. Example 1:Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]Output: 4Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.Example 2:Input: nums = [2,7,9,3,1]Output: 12Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 2), rob house 3 (money = 9) and rob house 5 (money = 1).Total amount you can rob = 2 + 9 + 1 = 12. Constraints: * 1 <= nums.length <= 100 * 0 <= nums[i] <= 400"
